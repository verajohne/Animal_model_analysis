# sheep_model_analysis
sheep_model_analysis aims to model epidemiology in herds of sheep. Based on real data from GPS loggers in herds of sheep, the goal is to create a realistic model of epidemiology in herds of sheep. We want to discover how accurate of a model, or more precisely what kind of model, is necessary to realistically model epidemiology in a herd or multiple herds in a field.
